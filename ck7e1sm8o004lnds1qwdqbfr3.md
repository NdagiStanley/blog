## #Local #Tech hustle: ShufflePCs | Custom built PCs

> Of PCs, custom build or off the shelf?

You don't have to settle for the specs you read for PCs (Personal Computers) on display at your local stores in the city or town. PCs are rarely on display for that matter. Most customers are in favour of mobility and versatility hence the prevalence of stores selling smartphones, tablets and laptops.

Yet there is a demographic that is after PCs; the gamers, architects, etc. You have three options:

- Find a store that has a PC for you

    This works if you are either not very particular with your needs or you can make due with the default configurations or your wallet can accommodate a specked out PC.
- Build your own PC

    You'd opt for this if you know what you are doing or feeling confident being a seasoned viewer of videos from [Linus Tech Tips](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXuqSBlHAE6Xw-yeJA0Tunw). The components can be found locally if you search around or can be bought online and shipped üí∞

These two options have their gotchas and limitations. This is the situation I got myself into up until I consulted.

- Order a custom-built PC

    Well, well, well...

    In case you're wondering, I am not so much of a gamer. The technical team at my church was in the market for a machine, cool ay üòé!

My consulting proved successful. I was introduced to [ShufflePCs](https://shufflepcs.co.ke/).

## My build

I checked out their [IG account](https://www.instagram.com/shufflepcs/), whatsapp'd them, got a quote, adjusted it (since I could source some components myself), paid 50% then after ~21 days the build was ready. My build took a bit longer since I was a bit too much on specifics of everything and I am glad they were patient with me in the frequent backs and forths.

With all components shipped and the build all set, they indulged my curiosity so that I could participate in the build ü§Ø. Finally, as normal procedure stress tests are done and you'll have the numbers sent to you under a catchy alias or code-name for the build. Overall, I was impressed and walked away a satisfied customer; of course, having settled the deficit 50%.

## Your build

I was a bit involved in the process but for someone with little to no time to get involved the steps are quite simple:
- Get a quote (Click on `Free Quote` on [ShufflePC's contact page](https://shufflepcs.co.ke/contact))
- The team will engage to finalize on the details
- Pay up 50%
- The build starts
- Pick it up or have it delivered (as you settled the deficit)

This takes 21 days and the package comes complete with a one-year warranty üèÜ.
