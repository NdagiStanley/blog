# Your free domain and a landing page

When I started out, seeking to have a custom web presence (beyond having an email and Facebook account), I was pleasantly surprised to find out that I could get a free domain. I gravitated to **.tk** since it is the short form of TechKenyans (now TechKln), a community I run üí™. At first, it was for testing purposes but I have come to use it for keeps: [stanmd.tk](https://stanmd.tk).

Below, I take you through the process of having a domain and a landing page for free. I believe this is the epitome of a **free and accessible** internet. Anyone can have a place to call home in the World Wide Web!

## Getting a free domain

[DotTK](http://www.dot.tk/) (_please note the link is not https_) claims to be the only TLD domain-name registry that provides free domain names.

### What's the catch?
Well, the details about the company are [here](http://www.dot.tk/en/aboutdottk.html). Simply put, it is a joint venture with several parties, chief among them; the government of a little known country, [Tokelau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokelau). The atolls (islands, _loosely explained_) of this tiny country are right at the international dateline; interesting story [here](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-16351377). I think this place is worth a [visit](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=visit+Tokelau). Anyway, I digress üòÅ

The mission of *DotTK* is to increase the country's publicity globally. If you did not know of this country up until now, we can agree they are succeeding. I'm sure you figured out that [**.tk**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.tk) is their ccTLD. The knowledge all comes together, right? Secondly, it's also profitable for the country. The proceeds out of royalties of this ccTLD have increased over 10% of the country's GDP (\*the smallest economy in the world).

The domains are purchased on [freenom.com](https://www.freenom.com/). You might have guessed it; free domains have some limitations. However, when it's written FREE it is actually free! Not like others who 'give' a free domain if you purchase hosting or something else. Here's an [example](https://www.hostinger.com/free-domain) that I randomly came across. You can read the differences between paid and free domains [here](https://www.freenom.com/en/freeandpaiddomains.html)

### Let's get that domain
Head over to [freenom.com](https://www.freenom.com). There's no Register button here. These are the steps:
- Enter your domain of choice (without the TLD) in the field and :

- Click on **Check availability**
- Click on **Get it now!** and once it is selected click on **Checkout**

![Screenshot 2020-07-18 22.02.27.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1595099233219/IYNg6lOc4.png)

_Please note that I have selected a free domain out of the 5 TLD's that are free_ The rest can be found at the lower part of the page at prices claimed to be the cheapest anywhere.

- In the dropdown, *Period column* select up to 12 months FREE üéâ. Click on **Continue**. 

![Screenshot 2020-07-18 22.06.38.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1595099267461/ebi8oGzOa.png)

- The next page _Review & Checkout_, use **Social sign in** with Google and you're done!

    üö® I found out that *Facebook auth* is buggy and so is *Login with email address*. So just go with Google sign in üòâ

## Landing page

Here we'll be using **Netlify**.

### Quick way to do it

Create a folder and in it create a file `index.html`. Copy the code below and save.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Hello World</title>
</head>
<body>
    Hello World
</body>
</html>
```

I'm using the above code snippet to make things easy. If this is new to you, [here's a great resource on HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) (Your intro into web development).

Head over to [Netlify Drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop) to drag and drop your folder (in the area I've highlighted in _light green_)

![Screenshot 2020-07-18 23.15.39.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1595103475475/VtdkQrjpT.png)

Voila, it's live! If this is your first time deploying a site, I imagine this feels exciting. Feel free to celebrate then come back to continue üòä.

![Screenshot 2020-07-18 23.18.52.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1595103562353/p0OaWLeSe.png)

Click on **Sign up for Netlify** to claim the site. Use you're preferred choice.

![Screenshot 2020-07-18 23.23.02.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1595103799386/d6G4BbXua.png)

### Using Version Control

In the sign-up page, you noticed the three well-known code repository platforms; GitHub, GitLab and BitBucket.

I'll use GitHub going forward, in this tutorial. I'll sign up using GitHub. Past the _Getting Started Guide_ you have a screen like the one below.

You can drag and drop your folder as we did earlier or by clicking on **New site from Git** you can configure automatic updating of your site every time you push to your remote repository (repo).

![Screenshot 2020-07-18 23.27.32.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1595104676900/Esc7WDNMv.png)

#### Creating a GitHub repository

> Skip to the next heading if you're conversant with GitHub. Have a GitHub repo with your site's files on the ready.

If you don't have a GitHub account go ahead and signup [here](https://github.com/join). Once signed up, create a repo, I chose _index_ as the name of my repo.

![Screenshot 2020-07-18 23.30.29.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1595104844041/lJPHiV0xJ.png)

There are multiple ways to push code to your new repo. You can use either of the ones specified. This is the simplest way:

- Click on *uploading an existing file*

![Screenshot 2020-07-18 23.31.32.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1595105197611/HiW5QGHrj.png)

- Click on *choose your files*, (optionally) enter a _Git commit message_ and click **Commit Message**.

![Screenshot 2020-07-18 23.34.28.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1595105240417/K8V6COToS.png)

Your repo is then updated.

#### Configure Netlify and GitHub

In Netlify, after you click on **New site from Git**, you have a 3-step process to complete. Click on **GitHub**. Be sure to authenticate *Netlify* in the popup screen that appears.

![Screenshot 2020-07-18 23.50.55.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1595105947977/s4XY6K_3v.png)

Select the GitHub account you used to create the repo with the site's file(s) so that Netlify can be installed. Select whether you want Netlify to access all your repos or just specific ones.

![Screenshot 2020-07-18 23.58.36.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1595106097903/IdMgsyTWj.png)

I advise that you select **All repositories**. You'll be redirected to step 2.

![Screenshot 2020-07-18 23.58.36.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1595106291191/vPto90-7x.png)

Select the repo of choice. If you selected *Only select repositories* in Step 1; in future instances, you may not see your new repo listed. You'll need to reconfigure Netlify on GitHub every time you create a new repo.

![Screenshot 2020-07-18 23.53.02.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1595106239059/_Ol980IQD.png)

In Step 3, you specify to Netlify which folder is to be used and if there are any build commands to run before deploying. In our case (just having an `index.html` file at the root of the repo) we need not change anything. Click **Deploy site**

![Screenshot 2020-07-18 23.53.37.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1595106704151/Vj1J7BL6U.png)

## Tying the domain name and our site together

We're not yet done. We need to 'tie' the site and the domain together.

After the site is live, you'll be redirected to screen showing you that there are two more steps to go...
